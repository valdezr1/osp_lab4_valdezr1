Operating Systems Lab 4 | Recursive File Search <br>
Executable will take in three arguments:
1) Executable
2) Search Term
3) Starting Directory

Recursively, the program will seek directories and files that contain the search term as a substring and print to the console the absolute path from that directory/file. A directory is specified if it is appended with a ':'.
